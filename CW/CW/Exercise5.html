            Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (More)
            You persecute the weak
            Because it makes You feel so strong (Safe)
            Don't have much strength to fight
            So I look to the light (War)
            To make these wrongs turn right
            Head up high, I look to the light
            Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
            And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
            Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
            'Cause I, I look to the light</p>

            We on an ultralight beam
            This is a God dream
            This is a God dream
            This is everything
            Everything</p>
